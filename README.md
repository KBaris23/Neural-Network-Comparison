Performance comparison of Neural Nerwork Models in Reconstructing the Energy of Single Photon Data
This is part of a paper on "Performance Comparison of Neural Network Models based on Reconstructing the Energy of Photon Data". Paper was authored by Kaan Baris Oktay and Mehmet Ozgur Sahin. Single in the title refers to the dataset utilized in this paper containing only one photon per data. Yet, in total, dataset consists of 500000 photon data(1). Full references present on the paper.
